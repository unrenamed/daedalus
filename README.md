### Reference

Daedalus was an inventor, craftsman, architect and artist in Greek mythology, who had two sons, Icarus and Iapyx.

He is best known as the creator of the Labyrinth, a huge maze located under the court of King Minos of Crete, where the Minotaur, a half-man half-bull creature dwelt. According to the myth, the king of Athens was forced to pay tribute to King Minos by sending seven young men and seven young women each year to Crete, in order to be sacrificed to the Minotaur.
